 No need to write a program. Just pseudocode is enough.Define a class for a instagram post. Define the properties and functions.
Define which one will be private and which one public. 

class instagram{
	private String user;
private String caption;
private String URL;
private int like;
private int comment;

  public Instagram(String user, String caption, String URL,int like, int comment) {
        this.user = user;
        this.caption = caption;
        this.URL = imageURL;
        this.like = like;
        this.comment = comment;
    }
//Getter and setter for all the properties..

//All properties are private,they can only be accessed within the class.This is to protect the data from outside of the class.
}
