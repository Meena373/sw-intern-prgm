You are writing an essay. You don't want the any word to appear very frequently. Write a program that will take your essay as input (maybe from a file) and print the number of times each unique word appears in your essay.

Ans:
public class WordFrequency{

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter essay: ");
        String essay = scanner.nextLine();
        String[] words = essay.split("\\s+");
        for (String word : words) {
            if (!wordCounts.containsKey(word)) {
                wordCounts.put(word, 1);
            } else {
                int count = wordCounts.get(word);
                wordCounts.put(word, count + 1);
            }
        }
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCounts.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
